## Introduction

In the realm of sorcery, a powerful sorcerer seeks to create intricate magical arrays. To bring these arrays to life, the sorcerer requires a specific combination of magical crystals. Each crystal possesses its own unique properties and contributes to the overall magic of the array.

Let us explore the types of crystals available:

-The Lesser Crystal: This is the basic unit of magical power.
-The Low Crystal: It is worth 2 lesser crystals, amplifying the magic.
-The Medium Crystal: Its value is equivalent to 5 lesser crystals, offering a greater surge of mystical energy.
-The High Crystal: With a value of 10 lesser crystals, it channels potent magical forces.

With these dazzling crystals at our disposal, we are ready to embark on our journey of counting possibilities and weaving intricate arrays.

## The Sorcerer's Quest

Imagine that our sorcerer aims to construct a low defensive array, one that requires precisely 12 lesser crystals to materialize. How many ways can the sorcerer assemble different combinations of crystals to manifest this array?

## The Enchanting Algorithm Process

Our sorcerer has devised an elegant and recursive algorithm to solve the problem of counting possibilities. Let's dive into its magical workings:

To count the possibilities, we break down the problem into smaller subproblems.
The algorithm follows these steps:

1. If the number of crystals is exactly 0, there is one enchanting way to assemble them.
2. If the number of crystals is less than 0 or the available kinds of crystals is 0, there are no enchanting ways to assemble them.
3. Otherwise, the count of enchanting ways is the sum of two recursive calls:
   - One call reduces the number of kinds of crystals by 1 while keeping the same number of crystals.
   - Another call reduces the number of crystals by the denomination of the first kind of crystal while keeping the same number of kinds of crystals.

Let's demystify the process of assembling crystals by understanding a fundamental principle. Suppose we have a specific number of crystals we want to assemble, let's call it 'n', and we have different types of crystals: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The total number of ways to assemble 'n' crystals with these types can be broken down into two main parts. First, we consider the ways to assemble 'n' crystals using only 'a' and 'b' crystal types, without including 'c'. Secondly, we explore the ways to assemble 'n' crystals by utilizing all three crystal types, but subtracting 'c' from the total number of crystals. By adding these two results together, we uncover the diverse enchanting possibilities of crystal assembly, shedding light on the captivating world of sorcery.

By applying these rules recursively, the algorithm explores various crystal combinations and accumulates the enchanting possibilities.

## Crafting a Low Defensive Array

Let's consider our sorcerer's quest for a low defensive array that requires 12 crystals. By applying the algorithm, we can uncover the enchanting possibilities:

| Crystals   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
| ---------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [1]        | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 1   |
| [1,2]      | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 3   | 3   | 4   | 4   | 5   | 5   | 6   | 6   | 7   |
| [1,2,5]    | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 10  | 11  | 13  |
| [1,2,5,10] | 1   | 1   | 2   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 11  | 12  | 15  |

These enchanting possibilities showcase the various combinations we can create with different crystal denominations, offering the sorcerer a range of options to construct unique arrays.

For the Low Defense Array our sorcerer have 12 unique ways to assemble different crystals.

For the Medium Defense Array that requires 40 lesser crystals, our sorcerer has 195 unique ways to assemble different crystals.

## The Sorcerer's Automation: A Program of Enchantment

To expedite the process of calculating the number of ways to assemble crystals for various arrays, our sorcerer crafted a powerful program. This program employs the enchanting algorithm we discussed earlier, allowing the sorcerer to effortlessly count the enchanting possibilities.

Here is the code for the sorcerer's program:

```scheme
(define (count-change amount)
  (cc amount 4))

(define (cc amount kinds-of-crystals)
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-crystals 0)) 0)
        (else (+ (cc amount (- kinds-of-crystals 1))
                 (cc

 (- amount (first-denomination kinds-of-crystals))
                     kinds-of-crystals)))))

(define (first-denomination kinds-of-crystals)
  (cond ((= kinds-of-crystals 1) 1)
        ((= kinds-of-crystals 2) 2)
        ((= kinds-of-crystals 3) 5)
        ((= kinds-of-crystals 4) 10)))
```

Through this magical program, the sorcerer can simply input the desired number of crystals and obtain the count of enchanting possibilities, saving valuable time and effort.

## Conclusion

As we conclude our enchanting journey into the world of counting, we invite you to embrace the magic of algorithms and the art of recursion. May you be inspired to unleash your imagination, embark on your own sorcerer's quest, and weave captivating arrays that captivate the senses and stir the soul.
